Frontend Developer Test Task

Task:
Create a product page in a minimalist style using Radix UI components, which demonstrates your
understanding of modern UX/UI design standards. Make sure the page is well-designed, such that
you wouldn?t hesitate to add it to your portfolio as a small test project. If you are seriously looking
for a job, this is a good opportunity to show that you can create something beautiful and
contemporary.

Requirements:
1. Minimalist Style:
- Design the product page in a clean and modern style.
- Use components from the Radix UI library (selectors, buttons, and other elements).
- You may add custom styling (spacing, colors, etc.) to enhance the visual appeal.

2. Functionality:
- The product page should include:
- Product image.
- Product name.
- Short description.
- Option selector (e.g., size, color).
- "Add to Cart" button.
- **Image slider** ? the ability to scroll through multiple product images would be a plus.

3. Design:
- Follow modern e-commerce website design. Everything should be legible and logically placed.

- Responsive design is required (should look good on both desktop and mobile).

4. References:
- **Bonus:** It would be great if you can collect 5-10 examples of well-designed product pages that
you like or that inspired you for this task. This will help us understand your sense of style.

5. Deployment:
- You can deploy your solution on a platform like Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any other convenient
service and share the link.
- If deployment is not possible, you can record a screencast demonstrating the product page
running on localhost along with the code, and share a video link.

Important Notes:
- This test task is unpaid.
- You may use abstract products from any category, so there are no concerns that the result will be
used for free.
- You do not need to share the code, just ensure the page looks nice and modern. The goal is for us
to see it and say: "Yes, this looks good and well-designed."

Main Objectives:
- Showcase your sense of style and ability to create modern, visually appealing interfaces.
- Demonstrate an understanding of UX/UI basics and work with Radix UI components.
